# Avatar block

[Go to the List of Blocks](../block-editor/blocks-list.md)

Use the Avatar block to display the user’s profile picture on any post, page, or template. Although the block can be added anywhere, the most common use is in the single post template to display the author. Another use case is in the Query Loop block to include the post author’s avatar in the query.

To add the Avatar block, click the **Add block** button to open the block inserter pop-up window and choose the Avatar block.

If you want to add one in the Query Loop block, be sure to add it inside the Post Template block.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>/avatar</kbd> to quickly insert an Avatar block.

## Block toolbar

Every block comes with unique toolbar icons and blocks specific user controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor. To view the block toolbar, click on the *Avatar* block, and the toolbar will be displayed.

![The block toolbar for the avatar block](../../assets/images/2023/05/image-29.png)

There are six buttons on the *Avatar* block toolbar:

-   Transform to
-   Drag icon
-   Move arrows
-   Align
-   Duotone filter
-   Options

### Transform to

Click on the “Transform” button to convert the *Avatar* block into a “Group” or “Columns” block.

### Drag icon

![The drag icon on the avatar block toolbar](../../assets/images/2023/05/image-31.png)

To drag and drop the block to a new location on the page template, click and hold the rectangle of dots, then drag it to the new location. The blue separator line indicates where the block will be placed. Release the left mouse button when you find the new location to place the block.

### Move arrows

### Align

Use the change alignment tool to align the Avatar block. The following is a list of the block align options:

-   **None**
-   **Align left** – make the block left-aligned.
-   **Align center** – make the block alignment centered.
-   **Align right** – make the block right aligned.

Note that the align option is only available if the Avatar block is inside a container block.

### Duotone filter

The duotone filter lets you create a two-tone color effect without losing your original image.
