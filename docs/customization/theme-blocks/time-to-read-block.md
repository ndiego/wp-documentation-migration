# Time to Read block

The Time to Read block shows an estimated reading time for the current post or page. You can display a single time (for example, 3 min) or a time range (for example, 3–4 min). A Word Count variation is also available if you prefer to display the total number of words instead.

## Requirements

-   WordPress 6.9 or later.

## Add the Time to Read block

1.  Open a post or page in the editor.
2.  Place your cursor where you want the block to appear.
3.  Open the block inserter (+) and search for “Time to Read.”
4.  Select Time to Read to add it.

Tip: You can switch between Time to Read and Word Count using the block’s variation picker after inserting it.

## Block toolbar

-   Transform: Switch between Time to Read and Word Count variations.
-   Drag/Move: Reorder the block on the page.
-   Alignment: Align left, center, or right.
-   More options: Duplicate, remove, and other standard block actions.

## Block settings

### Display as range

By default, this is enabled to show a small range (for example, 3–4 min) rather than a single average value. You can toggle this on and off to your liking.

### Word Count (variation)

The block comes with a variation that shows the total word count of the current post or page. You can switch to this variation by either adding it directly or transforming to it.

### Advanced

The following Advanced settings options are available: HTML Anchor, Additional CSS Class(es), Additional CSS, and Styles.

### Tips

-   Place Time to Read near the title or byline so readers see it immediately.
-   Use consistent styling across posts for a cohesive look.
-   Consider using the Word Count variation for long-form content alongside Time to Read, depending on your audience.

## How it’s calculated

-   The estimate is based on the content of the current post or page and uses language-aware counting (words or characters depending on your site language).
-   Time to Read shows minutes; there isn’t a setting for seconds or custom words-per-minute in WordPress 6.9.

## Where it works best

-   Posts and pages in the post editor.
-   In templates or patterns, values display based on the current content context. Preview with a specific post or page to see realistic results.

## Frequently asked questions

**Can I change the reading speed (words per minute)?**

-   Not in WordPress 6.9. The estimate uses a default reading speed and language-aware counting.

**Can I show seconds or more precise timing?**

-   No. The block displays minutes, either as a single value or a range.

**Does it count text inside all blocks?**

-   It estimates based on your post/page content. Dynamically loaded content (shortcodes, external embeds, or content injected by plugins) may not be fully reflected.

## Troubleshooting

The value looks wrong or shows a very low number:

-   Make sure you’re viewing a single post or page, not an index/archive.
-   Update or save your draft to ensure the editor reflects your latest content.
-   If your page relies heavily on shortcodes or external embeds, note the estimate may not include all external text.

**Styles don’t match the editor preview:**

-   Theme styles affect the frontend appearance. Adjust colors/typography in the block’s Styles panel or via your theme’s design tools.

**The block doesn’t render in a template preview:**

-   Open a specific post or page preview for that template to provide the correct content context.
