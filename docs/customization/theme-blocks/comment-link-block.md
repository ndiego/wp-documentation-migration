# Comments Link block

The Comments Link block displays a link to the comments section for the current post or page. You can customize the link text and optionally include the total number of comments. This block is most useful in single post/page templates or inside a Post Template within a Query Loop.

## Where you can use this block

-   Single posts and pages.
-   Post Template inside a Query Loop (for example, on an index or archive template).
-   The block requires post context. It does not display on non-singular pages without a current post.

## Add the Comments Link block

1.  Open a post, page, or template in the editor.
2.  Place your cursor where you want the link to appear (for example, under the post title or byline).
3.  Click the + Block Inserter and search for “Comments Link,” then select it.
    -   Tip: You can also type /comments-link on a new line to insert it quickly.

## Behavior notes

-   If comments are disabled for the current post or the post is password-protected, the link may be hidden or disabled depending on your discussion settings.
-   When used in a Query Loop, each Comments Link points to the corresponding post’s comments section.
