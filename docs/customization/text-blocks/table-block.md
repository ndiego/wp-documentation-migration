# Table block

[Go to the List of Blocks](../block-editor/blocks-list.md)

Use the Table block to easily create a table in any post or page.

![Table block in editor](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-example.jpg)

## Add a Table block

To add the Table block to a page, click the **Add block** button to open the block inserter pop-up window and choose the Table block.

You can also use the keyboard shortcut <kbd>/table</kbd> to quickly insert a Table block. Remember that tables are best used for tabulated data rather than page design. For example, if you want columns, you can use the [Columns block](../design-blocks/columns-block.md).

> [!NOTE]
> [Detailed instructions on adding blocks can be found here.](../block-editor/adding-a-new-block.md)

## Block toolbar

![Table block toolbar](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-toolbar-inside-text.png)

Each block has its own block-specific controls that allow you to manipulate the block right in the editor. If you hover over the buttons, tooltips will tell you what is behind the buttons, and also show you keyboard shortcuts when available.

The block toolbar for the paragraph block shows these buttons:

-   Transform to
-   Block-moving tools
-   Align
-   Change column alignment
-   Add or remove caption
-   Bold and Italics
-   Link
-   More Rich Text controls
-   Edit table
-   Options

### Transform to

![Transform options for the table block](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-transforms.png)

Click on the “Transform” button to convert the Table block into a “Group”, “Details”, or “Columns” block. It’s also possible to change the style of a table to “Default” or “Stripes”.

### Block-moving tools

![Block moving tools highlighted on the block toolbar](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-toolbar-moving-tools.png)

Use the block-moving tools to move the Table block.

The **drag** or **six dots** icon allows you to freely reposition the block anywhere within the editor by holding the icon and dragging it to the new location.

You can also use the **arrow icons** to move the block up or down within the group of nested blocks or when there are multiple blocks.

> [!NOTE]
> [Detailed instructions on moving a block within the editor can be found here](../block-editor/moving-blocks.md)

### Align

![Block alignment tool for the table block](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-align.png)

Use the change alignment tool to align the Table block. Choose one of the following options:

-   **None –** leaves the block the current size.
-   **Wide width –** increase the width of the block beyond the content size.
-   **Full width –** extend the block to cover the full width of the screen.
-   **Align left –** aligns the block left.
-   **Align center –** aligns the block to the center.
-   **Align right –** aligns the block right.

The “Wide width” and “Full width” alignment settings must be enabled by your WordPress theme.

### Change column alignment

![Column alignment tool for the table block](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-column-alignment.png)

Use the change column alignment tool to align the columns of a Table block. Choose one of the following options:

-   **Align column left –** aligns the column left.
-   **Align column center –** aligns the column to the center.
-   **Align column right –** aligns the column right.

### Add or remove caption

![](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-toolbar-caption.png)

Use the add or remove caption option to toggle the caption of the Table block. You can apply bold or italic formatting to captions, or create a link.

### Bold and italics

![Block toolbar with bold and italics options highlighted](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-toolbar-inside-text-bold-itallic.png)

The Bold and Italics formatting options are used to customize the text in the Table block. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to enable these text formatting:

-   **Ctrl + B** or **Command + B** to bold the text.
-   **Ctrl + I** or **Command + I** to italicize the text.

### Link

Use the link option to add a link to the table. It’s also possible to set it to open the link in a new tab.

### More rich text options

The drop-down menu to the left of the [More options menu](../block-editor/more-options.md) contains a range of additional rich text editing options such as highlighting, inline code, strikethrough, and more.

### Edit table

![Edit table option for the table block](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-edit-table.png)

Use the edit table option to quickly manage rows and columns. It’s possible to insert a row or column before, insert a row or column after, and delete a row or a column.

### More options

The Options menu represented by three vertical dots on the far right of the toolbar gives you more features such as the ability to duplicate or remove the block.

> [!NOTE]
> [Read about these and other settings.](../block-editor/more-options.md)

## Block settings

![Block settings panel](../../assets/images/2019/03/block-settings-button.png)

The block settings panel contains customization options specific to the block. To open it, select the block and click the Settings button next to the Publish or Save button.

Here are the options for the Table block:

### Settings

![Table block settings expanded panel](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-settings.png)

The settings section provides three possible options:

**Fixed width table cells** – means rather than adapting the column widths to the content of the table, all columns will be equal width. This option is also available when the Table block is still in the placeholder state. As of version 6.6, this option is turned on by default.

![Settings are defaulted to fixed width table cells for a new Table block](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-fixed-width-table-cells.png)

**Header section** – adds a header section to the table.

![Table with a header section](../../assets/images/2023/03/header.png)

**Footer section** – adds a footer section to the table.

### Advanced

The Table block provides the following Advanced settings options: HTML anchor, Additional CSS Class(es), Additional CSS, and Styles.

> [!NOTE]
> [Learn more about advanced settings](../block-editor/advanced-settings-overview.md)

### Styles

![Table block styles expanded panel](../../assets/images/2019/03/table-block-styles.png)

Choose between the “Default” and “Stripes” styles for your table. The “Default” style has a plain background and borders around the cells. The “Stripes” style has alternating row background colors.

The final appearance of the table may vary depending on your theme.
