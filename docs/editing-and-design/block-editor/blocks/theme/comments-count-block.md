# Comments Count block

The Comments Count block displays the total number of comments for the current post or page. It’s most useful in single post/page templates or inside a Post Template within a Query Loop.

## Where you can use this block

-   Single posts and pages (when comments are enabled).
-   Post Template inside a Query Loop (for example, on index or archive templates).
-   Note: The block requires post context. It won’t display on non‑singular pages unless it’s inside a Post Template (such as within a Query Loop).

## Add the Comments Count block

1.  Open a post, page, or template in the editor.
2.  Place your cursor where you want the count to appear (for example, near the byline or meta).
3.  Click the + Block Inserter, search for “Comments Count,” and select it. Tip: You can also type /comments count on a new line to insert it quickly.

## Behavior notes

-   The block respects your Discussion settings. If comments are disabled, the count may show 0 or be hidden depending on your theme and settings.
-   If a post is password‑protected, the count may be hidden until the password is entered (behavior can vary by theme).
-   When used in a Query Loop, each Comments Count displays the correct total for its corresponding post.
