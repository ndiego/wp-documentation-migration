# Scribd embed

By using the *Scribd embed block*, you can embed various articles, e-books, or research papers into your posts and pages. You don’t need a Scribd account to embed an article, although what you are embedding needs to be public.

*Example of an Embedded Scribd article*

## Steps to embed an article from Scribd

1.  On the Scribd app, click on the article that you want to embed in your post/page & click on the “Embed” option

2.  After clicking on the “Embed” option, a pop-up will appear with several options:

![The pop up Embed panel with options.](../../../../assets/images/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-3.png)

It contains several options for you to choose from. Here you can choose the size of your article/e-book, choose the page number it starts from, as well as see a preview of your document.

3.  After altering the options in the pop-up as per your needs, copy the URL on the top of this pop-up

4.  Add a Scribd Embed block to your page or post by clicking on the **(+)** Block Inserter icon and selecting the *Scribd block*.. Alternatively, you can type `/scribd` and press <kbd>enter</kbd>.

6.  Click the “Embed” button. If it’s a link that can be successfully embedded you will see a preview in your editor.

If you use a URL that can’t be embedded, the block shows the message *“Sorry, this content could not be embedded.”*

In that case, you’ll have two choices: Try again with a different URL or Convert to a link.

## Block Toolbar

Besides the Mover and Drag & Drop Handle, the Block Toolbar for the Scribd embed shows four buttons:

-   Transform to
-   Change alignment

**Transform to:**

You can transform a Scribd embed into a Paragraph, Group, or Column. Transforming it into a Group would give you the ability to change the background color and other settings of the Scribd embed, as shown below:

**Change alignment**

![Alignment options for the Scribd block: wide width, full width, align left, align center, and align right.](../../../../assets/images/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-12.png)

-   **Wide width** – Increase the width of the block beyond the content size
-   **Full width** – extend the Scribd block to cover the full width of the screen.
-   **Align left** – Make the Scribd block left aligned
-   **Align center** – Make the Scribd block alignment centered
-   **Align right** – Make the Scribd block align right

*“Wide width” and “Full width” alignment need to be enabled by the Theme of your site.*

**Edit URL**

Via the edit URL, you can change the Scribd Embed URL in the embed block. Overwrite the existing URL and click on the “Embed” Button.

## Block Settings

Besides the Advanced section, the Scribd embed has only one other setting in the “Block Settings” sidebar: Media Settings.

**Media Settings**

![Media settings for the Scribd embed block with the toggle OFF for resizing on smaller devices.](../../../../assets/images/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-15.png)

![Media settings for the Scribd embed block with the toggle ON for resizing on smaller devices.](../../../../assets/images/2022/08/Scribd-Embed-HelpHub-SS-16.png)

Via the *Media Settings* you can control the behavior of your embed when viewed from a smaller device, like on a phone screen.

The Toggle switch turns on or off the resize functionality for smaller devices. The default setting is “on” or blue.

**“Off:”** This embed may not preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. In the off position, the toggle switch is gray.

**“On:”** This embed will preserve its aspect ratio when the browser is resized. The toggle switch turns blue in the “On” position.

**Advanced**

The following Advanced settings options are available: HTML Anchor, Additional CSS Class(es), Additional CSS, and Styles.
