# Command Palette

The **Command Palette** offers you a way to quickly navigate and manage your entire site with the ability to invoke different actions such as:

-   Navigate to a different part of your dashboard, from the Media Library to creating a new post.
-   Search for individual posts or pages and create new ones.
-   Search through templates, template parts and patterns.
-   Add custom CSS.
-   Access Styles and style revisions.
-   Transform and manipulate blocks.
-   Toggle settings and preferences.
-   Reset customisations.

It exists in any admin screen, the Site Editor, and the Post/Page editor. It is not available when you view the front end of your site.

## How to access the Command Palette

To access the Command Palette, use the keyboard shortcut `Cmd+k` on Mac or `Ctrl+k` on Windows anywhere in your site. Once the command line opens, you can start typing to search for the action or content you want. Please note that the [keyboard shortcut is not available in some environments](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/51737) at the moment.

You can also invoke it specifically when you’re in the Site Editor and click on the title, at the top center of the editor.

WordPress 7.1 brings the Command Palette everywhere. It now shows in the admin bar, making it easier to find. Command Palette now be reach via the Search + Cmd+K icons for Mac and the Search + Ctrl+K icons for Windows and Linux in the WordPress admin bar.
